This App is an interactive guide to using Git and GitHub.
- It will walk you through the essential commands and concepts, from creating a repository to pushing your code to GitHub.

The environment while interactive, is a simulation.
- You will repeat the same steps on your computer to use Git and GitHub.

## Terminal

The simulation uses a virtual terminal, but you will have to access and use the terminal on your specific operating system.

🍏 **Mac** Terminal Access You can open the Terminal app on a Mac by going to the Applications folder, then into the Utilities subfolder, and double-clicking on Terminal. Alternatively, you can use Spotlight Search by pressing Command + Space and typing 'Terminal.'

💻 **Windows** Command Prompt On Windows, you can access the Command Prompt (which serves as the terminal) by typing 'cmd' in the Start menu search bar or by pressing Windows + R, then typing 'cmd' in the Run dialog.
