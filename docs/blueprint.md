# **App Name**: GitJourney

## Core Features:

- Guided Git Workflows: Interactive, step-by-step instructions for essential local Git operations: initializing a repository, creating/modifying files, staging changes with 'add', and committing with 'commit'.
- File System Visualizer: A conceptual UI that visually represents a project directory, allowing users to 'create' and 'modify' files and folders within the app's simulated environment.
- Commit History Display: A simplified visualization showing the progression of commits on a branch, illustrating the history and status of the project.
- GitHub Setup Assistant: Clear, guided instructions on how to create a new repository on GitHub and subsequently link a local Git project to it for remote operations like 'push'.
- Interactive Command Prompt: A simulated command-line interface within the application where users 'type' Git commands and receive immediate visual feedback on their effect.
- AI Git Explainer Tool: Leverages generative AI to provide concise, context-aware explanations for Git concepts, commands, common usage patterns, and troubleshooting tips directly relevant to the tutorial steps.
- Progress Tracker: Allows users to save and track their completion through different Git topics and workflow steps, enabling them to resume learning at any time.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A sophisticated forest green (#367245) reflecting growth, clarity, and precision. It serves as a strong anchor in the design.
- Background color: A subtle, desaturated sage (#EFF2F0) that complements the primary green, providing a calming and clean canvas for learning.
- Accent color: A vibrant, clear lime green (#B7E618) to highlight interactive elements and call-to-actions, providing a dynamic contrast.
- Headlines will use 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for a modern, slightly technical feel that aligns with the app's focus. Body text will use 'Inter' (sans-serif) for its high readability and neutral, objective appearance in longer explanations.
- For displaying code snippets and command-line interactions, 'Source Code Pro' (monospace sans-serif) will be used to maintain code formatting and clarity.
- Utilize minimalist line-art icons, inspired by Git/GitHub symbols, to visually represent commands, files, and workflow stages, enhancing conceptual understanding.
- The layout will feature a clean, two-column design: one for instructions and explanations, and the other for the interactive Git terminal and file system visualizer, ensuring clear separation and focus.
- Subtle animations and transitions, particularly when showing changes in file status or commit history, will be used to provide clear feedback and improve user engagement without being distracting.
