**Vicki**
- add to the app create new files, add content to files, save, add, commit, push

**Gemini**
- Of course. I'll enhance your GitJourney application to include steps for modifying a file, staging that modification, and committing it. 
- This will give users a more complete picture of the daily Git workflow.

Here are the changes I'll make:

- I'll update the tutorial provider to handle file modifications.
- I'll add new steps to the tutorial that guide the user through changing a file, running git status, and then staging and committing the new version.
- This will provide a more comprehensive learning experience.

**da4bfd1**
- The tutorial has now been updated to include the file modification workflow. 
- I've updated the logic and added several new steps to guide users through the process of changing a file and committing those changes.



**Vicki**
- Change name of app yo GitJourney by Dr. Vicki

**Gemini**
- Of course! I'll update the app's name to "GitJourney by Dr. Vicki". 
- I'll change the title in the browser tab and update the main header of the application.

**468c387**
- I've updated the app's name. Let me know if there is anything else I can help with


**Vicki**
- remove the create File Button and add how to create a folder and files using the terminal

**Gemini**
- Of course! I'll update the application to teach creating files and directories from the terminal, which is a fundamental skill.

_ This is a great suggestion to make the simulation more realistic. 
- I'll remove the "Create File" button and update the tutorial to guide users through using the mkdir (make directory) and touch (create file) commands in the terminal.

This requires a few changes:

- I'll update the tutorial steps to introduce these new commands.
- I'll refactor the file system simulation to handle directories.
- I'll update the file system visualizer to display files inside their directories.

Here are the changes.

**05069dc**
- I've updated the tutorial to teach creating files and directories from the terminal. - - This involved removing the 'Create File' button from early steps and refactoring the underlying simulation to handle a file system with directories. 
- Enjoy the more realistic Git experience
